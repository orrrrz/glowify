# Privacy Policy for Glowify Chrome Extension

Last updated: 2024.12.25

## Introduction
Glowify ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Usage

Glowify is designed to maximize your privacy. We do not collect any information from users. Actually, we do not have any servers. But to translate or explain text, we need to use third-party LLM (Large Language Model) services, which you can choose from the options, such as OpenAI, Claude, Coze, DashScope, Moonshot, etc.

You can also choose to sync your highlights to Notion, which is a third-party service, in your own database.

Glowify only access your text selections and its context on current active tab, and need to remember whether you have enabled the extension on current tab or not. All these is done locally in your browser.

Also, we opensource the code of Glowify, so you can review the code and audit the privacy of Glowify.

### Third-Party Services
All third-party services are optional and fully under your control, including:
- Notion: Your highlights are saved into your own Notion database, it's optional.
- AI Services: Selected text is processed through your chosen AI provider.
- These services are governed by their respective privacy policies
